# Recommender_Systems

Recommender_Review_Corr is a recommender system for the MovieLens dataset that uses the correlation of user reviews to find similar movies.

"We see that some movies with the highest ratings, do not have very many ratings. The tale of the track star turned olympian "Prefontaine (1997)", is running away with a high rating score, but is limping in with only 3 ratings. While the force is with "Star Wars (1977)" in popularity, it doesn't shoot first in the ratings department."
